<p>Animals are our lives. We live and breathe animals, this is what makes us the perfect animal transporters for your loved pets. We are a small family run business. We have our own personal show and working kennels. We are KC and council licensed breeders ourselves and have achieved top honours in the show and working world of dogs here in the U.K. and in Europe. We are also Kennel Club Championship Show Judges.
We are keen falconers as well owning Peregrine falcons and Harris hawks. We found that there was no specific transportation services for birds so are proud to offer this service in specific built boxes. We have recently transported chinchillas and a few exotic reptiles competently to our customers who were very happy with our service.
We are always available for a chat and to answer any questions you may have. We understand other people transporting your loved pets can be a stressful time for the owners so we want you to relax and know they are in good hands. 
During the time your animal is with us we will keep you posted on our travels and also send you photos via WhatsApp or email.</p>

<h3>LIABILITY FOR YOUR ANIMAL</h3>
<p>We take the very best care of your animal whilst it is with us but it is understood by the owner that paws on trails Ltd can not be held responsible for any illness, injury, loss or death due to any cause whatsoever.</p>

<h3>VACCINATIONS and HEALTH CHECKS</h3>
<P>All vaccinations must be up to date, this includes yearly vaccines (or titre tests). If your pet is to be transported in or 
out of Europe then all paperwork and vaccinations must be up to date and valid for the travel. We require proof to be sent to us 
via email at pets@pawontrails.com. We cannot be held liable for any mistakes made by yourselves or your vet.
 All pets in our care must be microchipped and the location of the chip given to us for our records.The microchip must be readable. 
 We ask that when the de-wormer is given to your pet by the vet that your vet fills in a fit for travel form which we send to you for
  our records. We suggest you speak to your vet for all guidance but of course we will offer help wherever possible. DEFRA is also 
  another good port of call for any information you would need. 
  They can be contacted via their website https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contact-DEFRA</p>

<h3>Liability for your pet.</h3>
<p>We take the very best care of your pet whilst they are travelling with us. But it must be understood by the owner that Paws on Trails LTD cannot be held responsible for any illness, injury, loss or death due to any cause whatsoever</p>

<h3>Our Booking Procedure</h3>
<p>When your pet travels with us we consider it one of our own, meaning that all care and attention is given to your pet throughout their time with us. We make sure we do our very best for you and your loved pet. 
So that we can do our best for your pet we want to know as much information about your pet that you can give us. This ranges from their character their likes and dislikes what they enjoy as treats and what their diet is. We only feed what your feed so as not to upset their tummies during the journey. We need to know if they are dog friendly or prefer not to socialise around other dogs. Also we need to know if we are dealing with any aggressive dogs. Before we send you a quote all this criteria will be needed. 
We ask for 25% of a non refundable deposit to be made when booking and the remainder paid and received 48 hours prior to trip. Any changes to the booking we try to accommodate for and providing we are given enough notice we cannot see this being an issue.</p>

<h3>Exercising of your pets</h3>
<p>Whilst your pet is with us we exercise them on leads, unless they are Cats, Birds or small furries. 
We use slip rope leads as these we find are easier to get on and off with less stress to the animal. If any went request us not to use a slip lead please notify us during booking and let us know your preference. 
We tend to stop at secure areas where we know we can safely walk your pets while with us. We have links to several secure dog fields that we are able to use during our trips as and when we need to.
</p>

<h3>Our Motto</h3>
<p>We always commit to transporting your pets throughout U.K and Europe with the same live and cate as if they are our own. 
Offering the Best service and the Best prices youâ€™ll have peace of mind knowing your pet is in the Best care.</p>
